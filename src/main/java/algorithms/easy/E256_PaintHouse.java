 * <p>
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * All costs are positive integers.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
 *              Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
